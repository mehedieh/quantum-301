### ðŸ§ª Question: Wave Nature of Two Objects

**Object A** has a rest mass of **60 kg** and is moving with a velocity of **80 km/h**.  
**Object B** has a rest mass of **\( 2.139 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{g} \)** and is moving with a velocity of **\( 0.99998c \)**.

> **Which object exhibits a more pronounced wave nature?**  
> Justify your answer using the concept of **de Broglie wavelength**.
